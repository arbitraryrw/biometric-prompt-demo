# Biometric Prompt Demo
Nikola Cucakovic, November 2019

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to showcase some of the basic features availble in the [BiometricManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/biometric/BiometricManager) and [BiometricPrompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) classes introduced in Android 10. These biometric handlers aim to:

1. Simplify the complexity of integrating biometric authentication  
2. Superseed exsisting methods of integrating biometric authentication, such as the [FingerprintManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager) for fingerprint biometrics
3. Create a single API for developers to interface with any biometric type, whether it is facial recognition, fingerprint, or iris etc.
4. Abstract biometric idiosyncrasies from developers

This code is purely for demonstration purposes and is not complete.
